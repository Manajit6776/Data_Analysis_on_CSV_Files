## Dependencies
- Python 3.6+
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to create a data analysis project for beginner:
- First, create a .ipynb file
- Download a .csv dataset from Kaggle
- Copy every line from the given code and run it separately. In that way, you can understand what the code wants to tell us
- Now time to research and learn in-depth.
  - Find out more dataset and work on it, use ChatGPT to give you daily work, and submit it to GitHub.
  - Use GfG or W3 to learn the models and ML library.
